## 🗂️ **Game Setup**

# 🔄 **Gameplay Rules**

## 1️⃣ **Following Suit**

Each round starts with a **lead suit**, determined by the first card played.

- Players **must follow suit** if they have a card of that suit
- Example: If the round begins with ♠ (Spades), all players must play a Spade if possible

---

## 2️⃣ **When a Player Cannot Follow Suit**

If a player has **no card** from the lead suit, they may:

- Play **any off-suit card**

This immediately triggers a **Penalty Round**.

# 🟥 **Penalty Round Rules (Updated)**

A **Penalty Round** occurs when:

- **Any player** (regardless of position) plays an **off-suit card**
- This causes the round to **end immediately**, even if not all players have played yet

### 🔔 At the moment the off-suit card is played:

- Stop the round instantly  
- Consider **only the cards already played on the table**  
- Identify the **highest card of the lead suit so far**

### ❌ **Penalty Assigned To**
> The player who played the **highest-ranking card** of the **lead suit** (among cards played so far)

That player must **collect all cards** on the table from that broken round.

### 🃏 **Card Ranking (High → Low)**
**A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2**

Sequence of plays:

1. Player 1 → **A♠**  
2. Player 2 → **10♠**  
3. Player 3 → **3♠**  
4. Player 4 → **♦7** (off-suit) ← ❗ *Round breaks here*
