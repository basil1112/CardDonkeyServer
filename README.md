## **Overview**

**Donkey (Kazhutha)** is a fun, fast-paced card game played using a standard deck of **52 playing cards** (Jokers removed).  
The game can be played by **a minimum of 2 players** and **no maximum limit**, though 4–6 players is ideal.

The objective of the game is simple:

> **Empty your cards before your opponents.**  
> The player who is left holding the **maximum number of cards at the end** is declared the **DONKEY (Kazhutha)**.

## **Game Setup**

-   Deck used: **52 cards** (all suits included, Jokers removed).
    
-   Shuffle the entire deck thoroughly.
    
-   Distribute cards **one by one** to each player until all cards are dealt.
    
    -   Some players may end up with one extra card depending on player count  
        (e.g., with 6 players → some get 9 cards, some get 8).

## **Starting the Game**

-   The player who holds **Spades Ace (A♠)** **must** start the first round.
    
-   They begin by placing **A♠** on the table to open the round.

## **Gameplay Rules**

### **1. Playing Cards**

-   Players must follow the **same suit** as the starting card of the round.
    
    -   Example: If the round begins with **A♠**, all players must play a **Spades** card.
        
-   If a player **has the required suit**, they must play a card from that suit.

### **2. When a Player Doesn’t Have the Required Suit**

If a player does **not** have a card from the required suit, they may:

-   Play **any card** from their hand (off-suit card).
    

This triggers the **Penalty Condition**.

## **Penalty Condition**

If at least one player plays an **off-suit card**, the following occurs:

### **The entire round’s cards are given to the player who played the **highest-ranking** starting-suit card.**

Ranking order (highest → lowest):

**A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2**

### Examples:

-   Round suit: **Spades**
    
-   Cards played: A♠, 10♠, 3♠, ♦7 (off-suit)
    
-   Highest Spade: **A♠**
    
-   The player who placed **A♠** must **collect all cards** from that round into their hand.
    

Collecting cards makes it harder to win—so avoid getting penalty rounds!

## **Clean (Non-Penalty) Round**

A round is considered **clean** when **every player** plays the **same suit** (no off-suit cards).

In this case:

-   All played cards are **discarded permanently** (folded).
    
-   The player who played the **highest-ranking card** in that round starts the **next round**.
## **Winning the Game**

The game continues until:

-   All cards are played **except those collected during penalty rounds**.
    

The players begin to run out of cards. Once all players are unable to play:

-   The player who ends the game with the **largest number of cards remaining** is crowned the:
